The entirety of this article was a result of departmental funding from the University of Oregon Math Department. 
The research was carried out over a 10-week interval during the summer of 2023. 
My advisor throughout the research was Professor Nicolas Addington who oversaw the work we committed as well as provided helpful insight into the topics we were looking into. 
While we did nearly all the work articulated in this paper, little of this would be possible without the direct assistance of Addington.
