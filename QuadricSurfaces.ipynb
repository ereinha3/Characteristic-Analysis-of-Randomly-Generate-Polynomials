The mechanism for creating arbitrary quartic surfaces is analagous to how random conic sections were created, coefficients were created using a random nummber generating function and the resulting equation was then evaluated in regard to its shape. The coefficients can then be made into a large matrix and a smaller matrix, both of which whose rank and determinant hold important information as to what shape the quartic surface represents. A further in-depth explanation of the mechanism can be found [here](https://lcvmwww.epfl.ch/PROJECTS/classification_quad.pdf)."],"metadata":{"id":"lbSBVtSAqF2t"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","ITERATIONS = 100000\n","def rand():\n","    return np.random.normal()"],"metadata":{"id":"RgWZ3aJbJXCr","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1695239477878,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Ethan Reinhart","userId":"10665102866111583183"}}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def get_tuple(array):\n","    evals = np.linalg.eigvals(array)\n","    pos = 0\n","    zeroes = 0\n","    for eval in evals:\n","        if eval>0:\n","            pos += 1\n","        if eval == 0:\n","            zeroes += 1\n","    return (pos, 3-pos, zeroes)"],"metadata":{"id":"TYqjALzFJX2f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1695239505782,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":409,"user":{"displayName":"Ethan Reinhart","userId":"10665102866111583183"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def calc_percent(num):\n","    percent = num / ITERATIONS * 100\n","    return round(percent,4)"],"metadata":{"id":"ttDUEGM4Jf0a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1695239507230,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Ethan Reinhart","userId":"10665102866111583183"}}},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def generate_probabilities():\n","    real_ellipsoid = 0\n","    imag_ellipsoid = 0\n","    real_elliptic_cone = 0\n","    imag_elliptic_cone = 0\n","    elliptic_cylinders = 0\n","    elliptic_paraboloid = 0\n","    hyperbolic_cylinder = 0\n","    hyperbolic_paraboloid = 0\n","    hyperboloid_one_sheet = 0\n","    hyperboloid_two_sheets = 0\n","    parabolic_cylinder = 0\n","    parallel_lines = 0\n","    coincident_lines = 0\n","    real_intersecting_lines = 0\n","    imag_intersecting_lines = 0\n","\n","\n","    for _ in range(ITERATIONS):\n","        a,b,c,f,g,h,p,q,r,d = rand(),rand(),rand(),rand(),rand(),rand(),rand(),rand(),rand(),rand()\n","        f /= 2\n","        g /= 2\n","        h /= 2\n","        p /= 2\n","        q /= 2\n","        r /= 2\n","        big_array = np.array([[a,h,g,p], [h,b,f,q], [g,f,c,r], [p,q,r,d]])\n","        small_array = np.array([[a,h,g], [h,b,f], [g,f,c]])\n","        tup = get_tuple(small_array)\n","        positives = tup[0]\n","        negatives = tup[1]\n","        k = negatives == 0 or positives == 0\n","        det = np.linalg.det(big_array)\n","        p3 = np.linalg.matrix_rank(small_array)\n","        p4 = np.linalg.matrix_rank(big_array)\n","        #
